The following was learned in Unit 1 Project 1:

- How to create different screens for your app
- How to build the User Interface / layout for each screen
- How to show a list of similar items (each item has a movie image, title, and description)
- How to retrieve all the information needed to display all of this data.

Some follow up questions: 
 1) Is there a way you guys can update the video? 
 2) When there is a lot of importing, can you please go through that part first, to then start coding? 

This was the first half to the application, which is going to be exploring Android 
development further with hands-on coding labs.

Part II: 

In this section, Flixster App got improved by doing the following:

- Passing data between screens
- Applying activity lifecycle
- Creating the layouts with fully defined constraints
- Adding primary actions in the app by using ActionBar or Toolbar
- Features that help with browsing and showcasing the movies trailers inside the app
