The following was learned in Unit 1 Project 1:

- How to create different screens for your app
- How to build the User Interface / layout for each screen
- How to show a list of similar items (each item has a movie image, title, and description)
- How to retrieve all the information needed to display all of this data.

Some follow up questions: 
 1) Is there a way you guys can update the video? 
 2) When there is a lot of importing, can you please go through that part first, to then start coding? 

This was the first half to the application, which is going to be exploring Android 
development further with hands-on coding labs.
